# Battleship

Interactive battleship game with 0 dependencies built with pure JavaScript. It was completed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about).

This project was completed following test-driven development (TDD) philosophy and using the Jest test-running symptom. It features drag-and-drop ship placement, random placement, and intellegent computer guesses.
